# StyleGAN2-ADA_Goldfish-Training

A goldfish dataset of approximately 2000 images have been used for StyleGAN2-ADA image generation and then we are going to label them for CNN image classification. THe last step is to evaluate the new algorithm of GAN-Self-Supervised Pre-Training.

With the current model, a FID score of around 40 has been reached and we are looking into further methods to decrease the FID score to bring it down to approximately 10 for higher classification accuracy.
